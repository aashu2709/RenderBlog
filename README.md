## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashu2709/RenderBlog.git
cd RenderBlog
```
### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
### 3. Configure environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables with your actual Appwrite and TinyMCE credentials:
```bash
VITE_APPWRITE_URL=https://<your-appwrite-endpoint>
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=<your-database-id>

```
⚠️ Ensure your Appwrite project allows connections from your development URL (e.g. http://localhost:5173) by setting the platform under Project Settings → Platforms.

### 4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:5173 to see the app running locally.
